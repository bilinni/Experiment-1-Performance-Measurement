#Performance Measurement for Bubble Inc#

The task is to evaluate which of the provided sorting algorithms works the fastest. The main
criterion is execution time in milliseconds.

In the following experiment report you will find the results of testing 4 sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSortUntilNoChange
- BubbleSortWhileNeeded
- QuickSortGPT
- SelectionSortGPT
6 different data types, 3 types of structurization, 3 input dimensions, and 2 triples.
  
The results include:
- Comparative results of all algorithms included
- Analysis of testing environment
- Analysis of forces that can affect the results
- Situational analysis of used algorithms
